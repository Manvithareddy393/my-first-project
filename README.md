# About my first project on GitHub.
The main features of the Hangman game project include:

1. Random Letter Selection: The game selects a random lowercase letter for the player to guess from the English alphabet.

2. Interactive Gameplay: Players can input their guesses one letter at a time. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect.

3. Limited Attempts: There is a maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed. Once the player exceeds this limit, the game ends, and the correct letter is revealed.

4. Feedback Mechanism: The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, informing them whether the guessed letter is in the word or not.

5. Display of Guessed Letters: The game displays the letters that the player has already guessed, preventing the player from guessing the same letter multiple times.

6. Play Again Option: After completing or failing the game, players have the option to play again, restarting the game with a new random letter to guess.

7. Input Validation: The game validates user input to ensure that only single lowercase letters are accepted as guesses.

8. Simple Text-Based Interface: The game features a straightforward text-based interface that allows players to interact with the game through the command line or terminal.
